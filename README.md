## Personal Profile

After 16 years of a steady, secure career, two amazing kids and in the midst of a global pandemic I quit my job to focus on a career I am **passionate** about.<br>

I’m fascinated by code and the way it can make a difference in everyday life through building innovative, user-centred products.<br>

The CodeClan experience has provided me with a foundation and I’m looking for a company that I can develop my progress, knowledge and understanding while making a difference from the start. My prior experience may be far cry from code however I have led or been part of successfully delivered construction projects for 16 years and look forward to utilising the collaboration and leadership skills developed in my next role in software.<br>

## Interests

I love being outdoors whether thats running the trails, hills or walking the dog with family.  Pre-pandemic I had begun to learn indoor climbing with my daughter. I enjoy reading and recently started sketching landscapes. I have a keen interest in global environmental issues - learning how i can make a difference while trying to lead by example for my children.
I find solace in pine forests.
